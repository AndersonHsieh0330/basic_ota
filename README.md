This repository includes a OTA design with sky130 process node.\
The primary purpose is to compare analog layout using Pcells in Magic and KLayout.\
The two softwares are both capable of generating Pcells
\
The two designs are as follows:
1. \
Layout Editing Tool : Magic VLSI\
Pcell Generation Tool : Magic VLSI\
Pre-layout Schematic and Simulation Tool : Xschem + ngspice\
LVS : netgen\
Post Layout Extraction : Magic VLSI\
Post Layout Sim : ngspice\

2. \
Layout Editing Tool : KLayout\
Pcell Generation Tool : KLayout\
Pre-layout Schematic and Simulation Tool : Xschem + ngspice\
LVS : KLayout\
Post Layout Extraction : undecided, probably has to be Magic\
Post Layout Sim : ngspice\
